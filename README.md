# Summary of the assignment

The software is used to display and operate the JSON tree, You can edit, delete, add the node on the JSON tree.
But not all the node on the tree can be added and deleted. For example, **"price"** key can only be edited, Because 
the price value is not contained in the array, so I think the **"price"** key only has one value.

**How to edit, delete, add node**
You can place the mouse on the **leaf node** on the tree and right click the mouse. The popup menu will be displayed.
